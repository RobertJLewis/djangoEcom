## Development Process

The development of this Django-based e-commerce store followed an **iterative, feature-driven approach**, ensuring that both functionality and user experience were prioritised at every stage.  

- **Iterative, Feature-Driven Development:**  
  The project was built incrementally, focusing on core features first, such as product browsing, cart functionality, and secure checkout. Additional enhancements, like responsive design and admin product management, were integrated in later iterations. This approach allowed continuous testing, feedback, and refinement throughout the development cycle.  

- **Django & PostgreSQL Integration:**  
  Django served as the primary backend framework, providing robust functionality for models, views, templates, and user authentication. PostgreSQL was used as the relational database to manage products, categories, orders, and order items, ensuring structured and reliable storage. Data models were carefully designed to maintain relationships and support future scalability.  

- **Responsive Design with Bootstrap 5:**  
  The front-end interface was developed using **Bootstrap 5**, providing a mobile-first, fully responsive layout. Pages, including product listings, product detail views, cart, and checkout, adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, offering users a smooth and consistent shopping experience.  

- **Admin Product Management via Django Admin Panel:**  
  The Django admin interface was customised to allow administrators to efficiently manage products, update prices, manage stock, and organise categories. This powerful backend functionality ensures that the store remains current and provides full control over inventory and product data.  

- **Version Control with Git & GitHub:**  
  Git was used for source control, enabling structured tracking of development progress, while GitHub served as the central repository for the project. Commits were made regularly with descriptive messages, ensuring a clear history of changes and allowing for collaboration and rollbacks when necessary.  

- **Testing and Debugging:**  
  Manual testing was conducted throughout development to verify functionality, responsiveness, and accessibility. Any bugs or inconsistencies were addressed iteratively, ensuring a polished final product. Browser dev tools and PostgreSQL queries were used to troubleshoot and optimise both front-end and back-end components.  

- **Deployment Workflow:**  
  The application was prepared for production deployment with **Gunicorn** and **Whitenoise** for serving the app and static files. Environment variables were securely configured for `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, and database credentials. The platform was deployed to **Heroku** with PostgreSQL on AWS RDS, following best practices for security and scalability.

## Future Implementations
The e-commerce platform has been designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the addition of new features and enhancements in future iterations. Planned improvements include:

- **Wishlist / Favourites:**  
  Allow users to save products they are interested in for later, enabling a more personalised shopping experience and encouraging repeat visits.  
- **Product Reviews and Ratings:**  
  Enable customers to leave feedback on products, rate them, and read other user reviews. This builds trust and helps shoppers make informed decisions.  
- **Multi-Currency Support:**  
  Introduce functionality for international users, allowing prices to be displayed in different currencies and improving accessibility for a global audience.  
- **Multiple Payment Gateway Integration:**  
  Expand payment options by integrating popular gateways such as PayPal, Stripe, or Apple Pay, providing users with secure, flexible, and convenient payment methods.  
- **Discount Codes and Promotions:**  
  Implement coupon codes, seasonal discounts, and promotional offers to enhance marketing strategies, incentivise purchases, and boost customer engagement.  
- **Enhanced Admin Analytics:**  
  Provide dashboards with sales tracking, inventory insights, and order statistics to help administrators make data-driven decisions and improve store management.  
- **Advanced Filtering and Sorting:**  
  Allow users to filter products by price, category, popularity, or nutritional attributes, and sort results for faster discovery of desired items.

## Accessibility
Ensuring accessibility was a key focus during the development of the e-commerce platform. The goal is to make the store usable for all visitors, including those with disabilities or assistive technologies. Key measures include:

- **Semantic HTML5 Elements:**  
  The platform uses proper semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) to structure content meaningfully. This improves navigation for screen readers and enhances the overall accessibility of the site.
- **Alt Text for All Meaningful Images:**  
  All product images, icons, and illustrations include descriptive `alt` text. This ensures that users relying on screen readers can understand visual content, and improves SEO performance for the site.
- **ARIA Labels for Interactive Elements:**  
  Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) labels were added to buttons, links, forms, and icon-only controls to provide context for screen readers. This ensures that users understand the function of interactive elements.
- **Full Keyboard Navigability and Focus States:**  
  Users can navigate the entire website using a keyboard alone. Focus states are clearly visible on links, buttons, and form fields, providing a smooth and intuitive experience for users with mobility or vision impairments.
- **Responsive and Readable Design:**  
  Text sizes, contrast ratios, and button placements were designed to meet accessibility standards, making the interface clear and easy to use across all devices.
- **Accessibility Testing:**  
  The site was tested using **Lighthouse** and **WAVE** tools to identify potential issues and confirm compliance with accessibility best practices. Manual testing was also performed to ensure that forms, navigation, and checkout workflows are fully usable for all users.

These measures ensure that the platform is inclusive, user-friendly, and compliant with modern accessibility standards, providing a positive experience for all visitors.
